/*
    apiCall -> is part of the lambda function that createRateLimiter returns. This lambda represents a rate-limited version of your API call logic.

    The parameter passed to createRateLimiter (let's call it apiCallFunction for clarity) is the actual API call logic you want to execute, but in a rate-limited manner.

    When you use the returned lambda function (e.g., limitedApiCall), you provide apiCallFunction as an argument to it.

In simpler terms:

    createRateLimiter gives you a special function (the lambda).
    This special function takes your API call logic (apiCallFunction) as input.
    Inside the special function, apiCall acts as a placeholder or alias for apiCallFunction.
    The special function then handles rate limiting and eventually executes apiCall (which is essentially your apiCallFunction).
